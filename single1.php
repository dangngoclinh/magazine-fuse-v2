                                        <p>People think focus means saying yes to the thing you‚Äôve got to focus on. But that‚Äôs not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I‚Äôm actually as proud of the things we haven‚Äôt done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.</p>
